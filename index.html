            <div class="aboutme">
                <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>The most important aspect of my life is my famliy. They are the ones who give me strength,
            and they're there for me in times of need. I am so thankful for them, and I'm lucky to have such
            a supportive force beside me.</p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>My favorite hobby is building and repairing PC's! I absolutely love the feeling I get after spending
                    all the time researching components, in some cases waiting for those components to appear on the market, then
                    putting it all together into an awesome-looking case and firing it up to see that awesome (or not so awesome) BIOS
                    screen, and installing the OS. That's been my passion since I was about 15, and every year that goes by the
                    technology just gets better and better, and I would love to have a hand in that.</p>
                <p>Another hobby of mine is partaking in the miracle of online gaming! Seriously though...
                    I love gaming. Whether it's an MMO, RPG, or a mix of both, I am playing it. However, that doesn't mean
                that I will just give any old game my seal of approval. It has to be at least Destiny, Bloodborne, Diablo 3 level.
